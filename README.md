This is outdated, the game has been updated since this was pushed there are two sets of code in it...

1 set of code actually hooks DirectX and messes with draw functions when specific objects are being drawn in order to acheive "chams" as well as a 'wallhack' (seeing people through the wall).

Later on I determined that there was no efficient way of doing this with just DirectX so I manipulated the actual engine of the game in order to draw enemy name tags and bodies through walls.
